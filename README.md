# Bitcoin Nonprofit Housing: Turning a 5-Unit Juneau Building Into a Transparent, Incentive-Aligned Experiment

I stumbled into an idea on a podcast that made me stop what I was doing and take notes. The short version: convert a normal rental into a nonprofit that takes rent in Bitcoin, transparently holds that Bitcoin on chain as a building reserve, and gives tenants upside through a simple, mechanical rent credit whenever the Bitcoin they paid appreciates. When the roof needs replacing or the windows need upgrading, you do not hike the rent. You use the reserve. Over time, rents in sats trend down, major repairs are prepaid, and everyone has line of sight into exactly where the money is and why.

That is the intuition. This article is me turning that intuition into a complete model. I am going to make the case for feasibility, lay out the incentives for every player, and then walk a very specific **hypothetical** case study: imagine a five-unit building in Juneau, Alaska. I will call it **Harborview Five**. I do not own this building. It is a simple stand-in so I can show how the model works in practice.

No mysticism. No hand-waving. Just a clear design you can implement.

---

## The Idea In One Minute

- **Pre-fund big repairs without rent hikes.** Take a portion of rent in Bitcoin and park it in a public, multi-sig reserve. As Bitcoin appreciates, the reserve outpaces CPI, so roofs, windows, and boilers get paid from sats instead of sudden rent increases.

- **Smoother cash flow and stronger NOI quality.** You replace emergency capex spikes with a scheduled, on-chain savings plan. Fewer surprises, less friction, and cleaner year-over-year financials.

- **Lower turnover, higher occupancy.** An upside-only rent credit makes good tenants stay. Retention cuts vacancy loss, leasing commissions, and make-ready costs.

- **Better leasing magnet.** “Transparent reserve plus upside credit” is a unique value prop. It fills units faster, reduces concessions, and creates a waitlist.

- **Fewer arrears and chargebacks.** Lightning invoices settle instantly. Funds are final. You can still allow USD for anyone who wants it, but BTC payers are less likely to drift late once credits start landing.

- **Community goodwill that actually shows up on chain.** Quarterly proof of reserves and visible capex spends build trust with tenants, neighbors, and potential donors. If you choose a nonprofit owner and qualify for local relief, property taxes may shrink and reserves grow even faster.

- **Simple compliance and normal accounting.** Accepting BTC for rent is a payment choice, not money transmission. You book fair market value on receipt, just like any non-cash payment. Tenants who prefer USD keep paying USD.

- **You keep control.** You set the reserve policy, the conversion rules, and the spend approvals. The upside credit is a lease term, not equity and not a pooled investment.

**How it works in practice**

1) Create or use a nonprofit owner with a clear housing mission.  
2) Accept rent in Bitcoin (USD optional) and hold the BTC in a public, multi-sig reserve dedicated to the building.  
3) Offer a mechanical, upside-only rent credit tied to BTC appreciation over a set window. No tenant downside.  
4) Publish quarterly proof of reserves and show every capex spend with a signed message and a receipt.

If this clicks, the rest of the article walks the full blueprint.

## Why This Is Feasible

You do not need a new law. You do not need a special bank. You need a clean entity, clean leases, clean accounting, and a clean reserve policy.

- **Entity**: a nonprofit corporation with a mission aligned to stable, affordable rental housing. You can lean 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) depending on your charitable positioning. If you go the 501(c)(3) route and truly operate for a charitable housing purpose, you may unlock property tax relief at the municipal level. That is optional. It is not required for the Bitcoin mechanics to work. It is simply additive if you qualify.

- **Leases**: standard residential leases with a simple addendum that explains the Bitcoin payment option and the upside-only rebate formula. This is framed as a rent calculation and credit. It is not a pooled investment. The tenant is not receiving equity. Keep the language tight.

- **Payments**: Lightning for day-to-day rent, on-chain for larger transfers. You can let tenants pay in USD if they want. If they pay in BTC, they participate in the upside credit. If they pay in USD, they get standard rent without the credit. You are not coercing anyone into crypto. You are offering a better deal for the people who want it.

- **Accounting**: on the day you receive BTC, you record the dollar value for your books. Your basis in those sats is locked at that number. When you later spend sats on a roof, your books show a gain or loss between basis and spend price. This is normal and manageable.

- **Compliance**: you are not a money transmitter because you accept Bitcoin as payment for rent. You are a user. Again, nothing exotic.

If you can operate a normal rental with a normal bank account, you can operate this with a multi-sig and a Lightning node. The difference is that everyone can see the building’s reserve and everyone understands the rent formula.

## Incentives That Actually Line Up

People do things that serve their incentives. In this design, the incentives are not fighting each other. They snap together.

### Tenants

- **Upside only**: pay in BTC and get a rent credit when BTC appreciates during the settlement window. If Bitcoin goes sideways or down in that window, there is no penalty. The credit formula is mechanical and predictable.

- **Stable rent structure**: no surprise hikes because you “need a new roof.” The reserve pre-funds big repairs. The obvious result is less rent pressure. If the city recognizes the charitable angle and gives tax relief, that amplifies the stability.

- **Transparency**: tenants can literally watch the building reserve in a public address. If funds move, they can see where and why, with a matching invoice and an on-chain outflow.

- **Agency inside the unit**: I believe in letting long-term tenants improve their interior as long as the work is professional and permitted where required. This turns a unit from a no-touch box into a home.

- **Sats as savings**: even if a tenant pays from dollars through a service, they begin to understand sats as a unit. In a bull cycle, the rent credits are a powerful teachable moment.

### Owner

- **Capex de-risked**: you stop funding roofs and windows from rent spikes. You fund them from an appreciating reserve.

- **Lower friction**: instant settlement, finality, no chargebacks.

- **Reputation and demand**: a building with a genuine lease credit tied to Bitcoin appreciation and a public reserve will have a waitlist. Good tenants want to be treated like partners.

- **Potential tax relief**: if you structure this as a true charitable housing mission and the municipality recognizes that use, property tax relief is on the table. Even without that, the core Bitcoin benefits still hold.

- **Better time preference**: a building with a visible reserve encourages disciplined maintenance, not deferral. You do not kick the can. You have the sats.

### City and Community

- **Less displacement**: stable rents reduce churn.

- **Better maintained housing stock**: an owner who shows their reserve and uses it for actual repairs is not squeezing the asset to death.

- **Public accountability without bureaucracy**: the proof is on chain. The story writes itself.

### Donors and Partners

- **Verifiable impact**: anyone can donate sats to the building reserve and watch them sit there until the boiler is bought. Every philanthropic dollar is cryptographically auditable.

- **Repeatable model**: once one building demonstrates this works, others can copy it.

## Case Study: A Hypothetical Five-Unit Building In Juneau

Let’s get specific. This is a thought experiment, not a disclosure of a property I own. Imagine a small five-plex in Juneau. I will call it **Harborview Five**. Here is how I would convert a building like this into a nonprofit Bitcoin housing experiment, step by step.

### 1) Entity and Mission

I form a nonprofit that exists to provide stable, long-term rental housing in Juneau with transparent, on-chain reserves and a rent formula that shares upside with tenants. The bylaws are boring on purpose. Independent board majority. Simple conflict policy. Clear reserve policy. The mission is not hand-waving. It is rent stability and maintenance discipline through a Bitcoin standard.

Could I pursue 501(c)(3) status and municipal property tax relief based on charitable housing use. Yes, if I dial in income limits or serve a defined group and actually operate that way. If I choose that path, I will do it right. If I choose not to, the core Bitcoin design still works.

### 2) Title and Transition

I transfer the five-plex to the nonprofit at fair market value. If I want to partially donate equity to seed the mission, I document that as a charitable gift. Alaska does not hit me with a state transfer tax, and Juneau is not adding one. The practical point is to put the asset where the mission lives and keep the books clean.

### 3) The Reserve Policy

This is the heart of the model. I publish a reserve policy that anyone can read in five minutes.

- **Multi-sig**: 2-of-3 with me, a tenant-elected representative, and a neutral local professional. Keys are held separately. Backups are documented.

- **Public facing**: a public descriptor for the reserve addresses per building. Anyone can watch. I post quarterly snapshots and signed messages.

- **Target**: a simple target like 12 months of operating expenses plus a five-year capex bucket based on a real schedule. The target is denominated in sats.

- **Sources**: tenant BTC receipts, optional philanthropic deposits, optional owner seeding. Fiat income is converted to sats based on the policy.

- **Uses**: capital repairs only, clearly listed. Roof, siding, windows, boiler, foundation. No admin items. No fluff. No exceptions.

- **Workflow**: when we need a roof, the board posts the bid, posts the approval vote, and then posts the UTXO spend with the contractor invoice. It is ridiculous how simple this can be.

This policy is what makes tenants believe the promises. Not a brochure. Not a tweet. An address with sats that sits there until it is time to fix the roof.

### 4) The Lease and the Upside Credit

Every unit gets a normal lease plus a Bitcoin Rider. The rider contains a mechanical formula for an upside-only rent credit. The formula can be simple.

- **Base rent**: stated in USD for clarity. Example: 1 bed at 1,700 per month. 2 bed at 1,900. You can update base rent when leases renew just like a normal building, but the goal is stability. The rider is the differentiator.

- **Payment option**: tenant may pay in BTC at the daily quote when the invoice is generated. The Lightning invoice shows sats. If they pay in USD, fine. They simply do not participate in the upside credit.

- **Credit window**: pick a standard window such as six months from the payment date. If the BTC they paid is worth more in USD at any settlement checkpoint within that window, they get a credit equal to a fixed share of that gain. I like a 50 percent credit for six months. It is generous, easy to explain, and obviously fair.

- **Ceiling**: add a cap if you want clarity for budgeting. Example: credit is capped at one month of base rent per six-month window. You can be more generous if your reserve is ahead of target.

- **No downside**: if BTC drops in that window, nothing happens. There is no surcharge. No tenant ever owes more because they used Bitcoin. Period.

This is not a pooled investment. This is not equity. This is a rent formula that rewards the tenant for opting in and lets them keep the upside of their own payment. It is also sticky. Once a tenant sees a couple of credits land, they do not switch back to USD.

### 5) Tenant Improvements and Responsibility

I put in writing what I already believe. Long-term tenants can make cosmetic changes inside their unit if the work is professional. New faucet. Light fixture. Paint. Flooring. If the work touches electrical or plumbing, it must be permitted and done by a qualified pro. If something breaks because of the tenant’s work, they fix it. On the building systems side, I remain responsible. Roof, structure, boiler, common areas. The reserve is for that. This creates pride of place for the tenant and clarity for me.

### 6) Payments and Tools

- **Lightning first**: monthly rent invoices go Lightning by default. Tenants can pay by scanning. If they are new, I will walk them through Strike or Cash App to fund the invoice from dollars. I do not need them to be Bitcoiners on day one. I need them to see the credit work one or two times. That is the unlock.

- **On-chain for large items**: deposit equivalents, back rent catch-ups, or philanthropic gifts can be on chain, directly to the reserve. It is slow by design. It is also visible forever.

- **Reporting**: I publish a simple table each quarter. Starting reserve in sats. Inflows by source. Outflows by project. Ending reserve in sats. Operating expenses are separate and boring.

### 7) Numbers You Can Feel

Let’s put some light numbers on Harborview Five. They are simple and they carry the intuition.

- Five units. Average base rent of 1,700. Monthly gross at full occupancy is 8,500.

- Assume Bitcoin at 100,000 per BTC for easy math. That is 0.085 BTC per month if every tenant pays in BTC. Over a year, 1.02 BTC into the reserve plus any starting seed.

- Real capex for a small building in Southeast Alaska is not theoretical. Roof and windows alone can sit in the six-figure range in dollars. That is exactly why owners push rents up in fiat terms. In this model, the reserve is aiming for 12 months of opex plus a five-year capex bucket. If my annual opex is 60,000 and my five-year capex schedule totals 250,000, I publish a target reserve of 310,000 in dollar terms. Then I talk in sats and track against the target in sats, not dollars.

- Now let Bitcoin move. If BTC prints 150,000 in the next cycle, that 1.02 BTC is 153,000 in dollar terms. If I seed the reserve with 0.50 BTC when we launch, that is another 75,000. Suddenly the roof is not a rent event. It is a scheduled spend. Tenants feel the difference because they do not get a letter saying the rent is going up “because the building needs a new roof.” They already paid for the roof. The proof is literally on chain.

- What about tenants and credits. Say a tenant pays 1,700 at a time when the day’s quote implies 17,000 per 0.17 BTC. I am keeping the arithmetic round. If, within six months, that 0.017 BTC is worth 2,000 in dollar terms, the gain is 300. The lease rider says they receive 50 percent of the gain as a credit, so they get 150 off a future rent. Two or three of those over a year is real money for a real person. It is also an easy story to explain to your friend who is suspicious of Bitcoin. You paid rent. You did nothing else. You got a credit because you opted in.

Rounded numbers, simple intuition, zero gimmicks.

### 8) Property Tax Layer, If You Want It

If I want CBJ property tax relief, I would couple this model to a clear charitable use. That usually means serving a defined group or capping rent relative to income for a portion of units. It is not a loophole. It is a mission. If I take that route, I will do AMI math, publish the policy, and operate it consistently. The way this touches the Bitcoin side is leverage. Tax relief means more of each rent dollar reaches the reserve. More reserve means capex without drama. Capex without drama means a calmer rent curve for tenants.

I am deliberately not getting lost in legalese here. The blog post is not a memo to the assessor. The point is that the nonprofit frame is not a fig leaf. It is a coherent way to match mission, money, and mathematics.

### 9) Timeline To Launch

Here is a clean 90-day plan for Harborview Five.

- **Days 1 to 30**: incorporate the nonprofit, appoint the board, adopt the reserve policy, set up the multi-sig, stand up a Lightning node, draft the lease rider, and build a one-page site with the public reserve address and quarterly reporting template. Meet with tenants. Explain the experiment. Explain that USD payments are welcome but the upside credit is for BTC payers. Collect questions.

- **Days 31 to 60**: pilot with two volunteer tenants who want the credit. Generate clean Lightning invoices. Confirm payments. Post the first proof of reserve and explain the math. Walk through the first credit when it hits. Keep it simple.

- **Days 61 to 90**: roll out the rider to all willing tenants at renewal. Publish the first quarter’s reserve report and a capex calendar for the next two years. If you are pursuing property tax relief, file the materials. If not, keep the focus on transparency and delivery.

At day 90, you are not theorizing. You are operating. Tenants have seen the dashboard and at least one credit. The reserve exists. The next time you post a roof bid and a UTXO spend, the building graduates from concept to culture.

## Real Benefits Now, Massive Benefits Later

Short term benefits are not just vibes. They are measurable.

- **Rent credits in bull windows**: nothing bouys trust like money actually flowing back to tenants. The moment someone sees a 120 dollar or 240 dollar credit hit their ledger, the conversation changes.

- **Visible reserve**: a single screenshot of the building’s reserve address with six months of quiet growth does more than a brochure ever could.

- **Tenant retention**: a stable rent formula and a credible reserve reduce churn. Lower turnover is a real cash benefit to an owner and a real life benefit to tenants.

- **Better vendor relationships**: posting a capex calendar and paying on time from a ready reserve makes you a preferred client for roofers and glaziers. Good trades show up for disciplined owners.

Long term benefits are exactly what you would expect when you hold a superior asset that appreciates over long arcs.

- **Capex is prepaid**: as the reserve grows in sats and Bitcoin appreciates in dollar terms, you stop praying the boiler makes it one more winter. You simply replace it on schedule.

- **Rents trend down in sats**: this is the line that terrifies fiat thinkers and delights tenants. When you denominate your targets in sats, two things happen. First, your costs are funded by a reserve that tends to outpace the CPI treadmill. Second, your base rents can hold steady or even drift down in sats over long arcs without degrading the building.

- **Neighborhood stability**: stable buildings anchor a block. People stay. They invest in their home. That is not abstract. You feel it when you walk the hallway.

- **Model spread**: once there is one working building with a public reserve and a history of credits, there will be a second. Once there are three, you have enough mass to share legal templates, reserve dashboards, and board practices so that anyone in town can stand one up.

- **Capital gravity**: donors like transparency. If they can put 0.25 BTC directly into a building reserve and watch it sit there until windows are bought, they will do it. If your mission is clear, you will find allies.

All of this is powered by Bitcoin appreciation and final settlement. That is the fuel. The nonprofit wrapper is the chassis that holds the fuel tank over the axle. The lease rider is the pedal that sends power to the wheels.

## Volatility Is Not The Problem

I am not interested in endless volatility debates. In this model, volatility is not a risk to tenants because their credit is upside only. It is also not a risk to the building because the reserve target is stated in sats with a healthy buffer before any big spend. Timing matters, sure. Discipline matters more. A building that saves in sats and schedules work is not speculating. It is simply exiting the trap where every repair forces a rent letter.

The real risks in housing are opacity, deferral, and perverse incentives. Opacity is solved by public addresses and quarterly posts. Deferral is solved by a real capex calendar and a reserve you do not raid for random wants. Perverse incentives are solved by sharing upside with the person who actually lives there and keeping the downside off them.

I am not saying there are no questions. I am saying the questions are managerial and design based, not existential. If you can run a normal building, you can run this. If you do it clean, volatility is a headline for people who do not live in your units.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do tenants have to be Bitcoiners.**  
No. They can pay in USD forever. The point of the upside credit is to create a simple reason to choose BTC. Most people need one or two credits to convert from curious to committed.

**What if a tenant pays in BTC and never sees a credit because the market was flat for six months.**  
That can happen. Then in the next six months they might see two. The rider explains the window so no one is guessing. Over time the upside credits show up. The long arc favors owners and tenants who keep paying in sats.

**What if the reserve is short right before a major capex.**  
Then you do what responsible owners have always done. You either delay the work until the reserve is topped off or you fund the gap with a short-term injection, then backfill from normal operations. The difference here is that the shortfall is visible months in advance. You do not surprise anyone.

**Is this legal.**  
Taking rent in Bitcoin is legal. Publishing a reserve address is legal. Offering a rent credit formula is legal. If you want property tax relief by operating as a charitable housing organization, follow the rules and actually do the mission. None of that blocks the core Bitcoin design.

**Do you give tenants equity.**  
No. This is not a co-op. It is a nonprofit landlord with a transparent reserve. If you want to explore co-op or CLT structures later, great. They stack nicely. The model I am describing is lean enough to execute now.

**Who holds the keys.**  
Two of three. One is the owner operator. One is a tenant-elected rep. One is a neutral third party. Keys are separated. Backups are documented. Any spend posts a signed message and a receipt.

**What keeps you from draining the reserve.**  
Public addresses, board oversight, and culture. If I promise tenants and donors that the reserve is for roof, windows, boiler, and structure, and then I spend it on office furniture, I am finished. The only reason this model works is because transparency makes nonsense career-ending.

## How To Measure Success

I like a small set of simple metrics that tell the story without ten spreadsheets.

- **Reserve coverage in months**: reserve sats divided by monthly opex. When this number trends up, the building is safer.

- **Capex on schedule**: number of planned projects delivered on time within a year.

- **Tenant credit rate**: number of upside credits issued per unit per year and the average dollar value. When people see credits, they tell their friends.

- **Turnover**: if you are doing this right, voluntary turnover drops. That saves real money even if you never publish the number.

- **Rent stability**: base rent changes per unit over two years. A flat line tells everyone the reserve is working.

Those metrics fit in a half page. Post them each quarter with the proof of reserves and you will have no problem filling your waitlist.

## The Long Game In Juneau

Juneau is not Manhattan. We do not need a thousand units and a battalion of lawyers to test good ideas. A five-plex is the perfect scale for a clean demonstration. Here is what I think the long game looks like if I execute this straight.

- Year 1: entity formed, leases updated, two of five tenants opt in to BTC, first credits land, reserve reaches six months of opex plus a small capex seed.

- Year 2: all five tenants opt in at renewal after seeing credits. A first capex project is paid on chain from the reserve with a signed message and a receipt. The post gets shared because it is obvious.

- Year 3: base rents hold. A donor drops 0.50 BTC into the reserve because they like the transparency. A second building across town copies the model.

- Year 5: a cluster of buildings uses the same templates, each with a public reserve and a simple rider. Tenants understand sats. The capex cycle is boring. That is the point. You do not raise rent to fix the roof. You fix the roof because the sats were sitting there waiting to do their job.

From there you can decide if you want to push for wider property tax relief based on the charitable side, experiment with a CLT ground lease for permanent affordability, or keep the model exactly as it is and just operate. None of those choices threaten the core. The core is a public reserve and a rent formula that shares upside with tenants.

## Closing: Do It Once, Then Show Your Work

This is not a Twitter thread. It is a working plan. If you own a small building, you can do this. If you are a tenant, you can bring this article to your landlord and offer to be the first to try it. If you are a tradesperson, you can be the partner who bids the roof and gets paid from a public address. If you are a donor, you can put sats directly into a reserve and point to the boiler that gets bought because of it.

Here is my commitment. I will open-source the lease rider, the reserve policy, the quarterly report template, and the basic governance docs after I run them once on Harborview Five. I will publish the address. I will make at least one capex spend with a signed message and a receipt. I will post tenant credit stats each quarter. I will not overcomplicate this.

Bitcoin is not a religion to me. It is a tool. It is a better way to hold value and a better way to settle it. Housing is not a narrative to me. It is a roof. It is a boiler that needs service and windows that keep the rain out. Put those two facts together and you can build a housing model that does not exploit tenants, does not hollow out the building, and does not rely on promises you cannot verify.

Run it once. Show your work. Then just keep going.
